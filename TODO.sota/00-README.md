# TODO.sota — 2026 SOTA campaign (client-usable quality)

Derived from the 2026-10-05 SOTA sweep (Arabic / Hebrew / Thai).
Goal: close the measured gaps to the 2026 frontier on all three
languages while keeping every artifact client-usable (int8, sha-verified,
multi-runtime, versioned).

## Substrate: HF (NOT Modal)

All training and eval jobs run on **Hugging Face Jobs** (`hf` CLI, v1.26+):

```bash
hf jobs run --flavor a100-large -d \
  -v hf://datasets/Interscript/hebrew-v4:/data:ro \
  -v hf://buckets/Interscript/isx-training:/ckpt:rw \
  python:3.12 python train.py
```

- Datasets: `hf://datasets/Interscript/<name>` (mounted read-only).
- Checkpoints/artifacts: `hf://buckets/Interscript/isx-training` (read-write).
- Detached always (`-d`); poll via `hf jobs ls` / `hf jobs logs`.
- Modal is retired for compute. It may be used ONLY to export corpora
  off Modal volumes during the one-time migration (#44).

## Standing rules that shape this campaign

- **NO LLM TEACHERS** (memory law, 2026-08): never use Claude/GPT/
  Gemini/any LLM as a label source for haraqat/niqqud/Thai IPA.
  WO06 is therefore noisy-student/self-ensemble — NOT the
  "LLM-ensemble teacher" phrasing used in the sweep notes.
- Versions/releases/cards/index are owner decisions at ship time;
  specs define gates, not version numbers.
- Data channel for shipped artifacts stays GitHub Releases + sha256;
  HF dataset repos here are TRAINING inputs, not the shipping channel.
- PRs only; no tags without explicit instruction.
